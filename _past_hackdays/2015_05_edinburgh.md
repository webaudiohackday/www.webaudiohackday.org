Part of ScotlandJS, the Web Audio Hackday was organised by Jan Monschke, Jan Krutisch and of course ScotlandJS's Peter Aitken. Mentors included Paul Adenot (Web Audio Spec Editor and Implementor for Mozilla) and Stuart Memo (of "JavaScript is the new Punk Rock" fame.

The three winning hacks were:

## 1. Place: "Fake guitar amp"

A very well tuned and balanced guitar effects stack running in the browser.

## 2. Place: "Song of Pong"

An experiment to make Pong playable for people without good eyesight by creating audible cues about the positioning of the puck in the 2d space.

## 3. Place: "The Hasselhoff experience"

A humouristic approach to a workout app that would start to play Hasselhoff tunes instead of running music as soon as you stop running. Running on a mobile phone and using the Web Audio API for blending the two different types of music and the Accelerometer API for finding out if you're stopping.
