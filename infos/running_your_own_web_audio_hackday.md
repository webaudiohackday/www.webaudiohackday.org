# Running your own Hackday

## Venue

Find a venue that's either cheap or willing to use this as a sponsoring opportunity. For example, in Berlin, we've been at [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com), in Edinburgh we've been at [Codebase](http://www.thisiscodebase.com/), an Incubator.

- You should have space for as many attendees as you think you can handle (this depends on the number of Mentors, but also on the interest you think you'll see)
- The venue should have stable Wifi that can handle your number of participants. Web Development is no fun without web access.

## Mentors

- You should have as many people who are familiar with the corresponding APIs as possible. If you can get some experts, that's even better. Feel free to contact us on recommendations. Let your attendees know that the they can ask the mentors questions non stop, because that's what they've attended.

## Sponsoring / Prizes

Try to get some sponsors for your hackday. Especially with the Web MIDI API, Web Audio Hackdays should be interesting to music hardware vendors. Try to get Mozilla and Google on board. We might be able to help, but this will need some action from yourself. Our goal for the sponsoring so far was to end up with 3-4 prizes people could win at the end of the hackday. This might be stuff like MIDI controllers, Software licenses or similar things. Usually potential sponsors find it much easier to give stuff/virtual stuff away than to actually pay money.

## Food / Drinks

This is completely optional. If you can find a sponsor who's willing to sponsor drinks and maybe a lunch, that's great. But if your venue is within reach of good lunch food places, that's also fine. Most of your attendees won't exactly be starving artists.



## A rough timeline

Of course, this is completely up to you, but we found that this worked quite well for the two hackdays we did:

| 10:00 | Introduction        |
| 10:15 | Web Audio Intro     |
| 10:45 | Web MIDI Intro      |
| 11:15 | Hacking starts      |
| 13:00 | Lunch               |
| 14:00 | Hacking commences   |
| 17:00 | Presentations       |
| 18:00 | Prizegiving         |
| 18:15 | Drinks              |


## Choosing winners

At Music Hackdays, usually sponsors choose winners. For a variety of reasons we've used a different model at the Web Audio Hackdays so far and simply did a private voting of all attendees. People are told to simply name their three most favourite hacks and those are counted as equal votes. If the top hacks end up with the same number of votes, let one of the organisers pick a winner :)
